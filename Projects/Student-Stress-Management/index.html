            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Situation</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                In UXD 1001 Human-Centered Design at the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE), my team of two members
                began a design sprint focused on improving how MSOE students manage stress during busy academic weeks.
                We found that many students struggle with managing time to ensure a balance between course work and
                personal time.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-12">Task</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                My role was to interview students to help define pain points that we could address in our final project.
                I spoke with students, found consistencies in results, and reported my findings back to the team so we
                could create a problem statement to guide the remainder of our research.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-12">Actions</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Through three student interviews, I inquired about daily routines, triggers of stress, and how students
                have learned to cope. I took notes during each interview, capturing the details that would later help
                identify patterns across different student experiences.
            </p>

            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                After completing the interviews, I drew connections between the different responses and organized my
                findings into an affinity map. This process helped visualize the common themes and pain points that
                emerged from the conversations.
            </p>

            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                With my team, I assisted in building a profile for a typical student who fits our pain points. This
                profile represented the composite of the students we interviewed and their shared struggles. After
                putting all our findings together, my team narrowed the problem enough to draft our How Might We statement.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-12">Results</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Our research revealed that the core of most issues is related to phone usage. Students consistently
                identified their phones as a source of distraction and a contributor to poor time management.
            </p>

            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                We determined that the best course of action may be to reduce phone usage before bed and immediately
                after waking up. These times proved to be particularly impactful on students' ability to establish
                healthy routines and get adequate rest.
            </p>

            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                We also found that reducing distractions created by phones during peak hours for classes or homework
                could improve student productivity. The pattern was clear: phone interruptions during these critical
                times significantly impacted students' ability to focus and complete their work efficiently.
            </p>

            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                We garnered a clear direction for our team to focus on during the Ideate and Prototype phases. The
                research phase successfully narrowed a broad problem into specific, actionable opportunities for design
                intervention.
