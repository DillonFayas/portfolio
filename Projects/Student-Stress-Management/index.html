            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                In UXD 1001 Human-Centered Design at the Milwaukee School of Engineering, my two-person team embarked
                on a design sprint focused on improving how MSOE students manage stress during busy academic weeks.
                The project came at a particularly relevant time, as many students were struggling to find balance
                between their coursework demands and personal well-being. Our goal was to understand the root causes
                of student stress and identify opportunities for meaningful intervention.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-12">My Role: User Research Lead</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                My primary responsibility was to conduct student interviews that would help define the pain points we
                could address in our final project. I took ownership of the interview process, from developing interview
                questions to synthesizing findings into actionable insights. This required me to approach each conversation
                with empathy and curiosity, listening carefully to understand not just what students said, but the
                underlying patterns in their experiences.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-12">Research Methodology</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                I conducted three in-depth interviews with MSOE students, each focusing on their daily routines, stress
                triggers, and coping mechanisms. The interviews were semi-structured, allowing me to explore interesting
                threads while ensuring I covered all necessary topics. During each conversation, I asked open-ended
                questions like "Walk me through a typical busy week" and "What happens when you start feeling overwhelmed?"
                to uncover authentic insights rather than leading participants toward predetermined conclusions.
            </p>

            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                As I conducted the interviews, I took detailed notes, paying attention to both explicit statements and
                implicit behaviors. After completing all three interviews, I began the critical work of finding patterns
                and consistencies across the different student experiences. This analysis revealed common themes that
                would become the foundation of our problem statement.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-12">Synthesis and Analysis</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                To make sense of the wealth of qualitative data I had gathered, I organized my findings into an affinity
                map. This process involved writing individual observations on sticky notes and then grouping them by theme
                and relationship. Patterns began to emerge around phone usage, sleep habits, time management, and
                distraction during peak productivity hours.
            </p>

            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Working with my teammate, I helped build a profile for a typical student who fit our identified pain points.
                We gave this persona a name, background, and specific challenges that represented the composite of our
                interview subjects. This persona would serve as a touchstone throughout the rest of the design process,
                helping us stay focused on real user needs rather than assumptions.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-12">Key Findings</h2>
            <ul class="text-slate-300 space-y-3 mb-6">

                    <span><strong>Phone usage was the core issue:</strong> Students consistently reported that their phones

                    <span><strong>Morning and evening phone habits:</strong> Students frequently reached for their phones
                    immediately upon waking and before bed, setting a negative tone for their days and disrupting sleep quality.</span>

                    <span><strong>Distraction during peak hours:</strong> Phone notifications and the temptation to check

                    <span><strong>Awareness without action:</strong> Most students recognized their phone habits were

            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-12">Problem Statement and "How Might We"</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                After synthesizing our research findings, my team narrowed the problem enough to draft our "How Might We"
                statement, a crucial tool in human-centered design that frames challenges as opportunities. Our statement
                focused on helping students reduce phone usage during critical times—before bed, immediately after waking,
                and during peak academic hours—to improve their productivity and overall well-being.
            </p>

            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                This framing gave us clear direction for the Ideate and Prototype phases of the project. Rather than
                trying to solve the broad problem of "student stress," we now had specific moments in the day where
                intervention could have meaningful impact. The research phase had successfully transformed a vague concern
                into a focused design challenge.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-12">Skills Developed</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                This project significantly strengthened my user research skills, particularly in conducting qualitative
                interviews and synthesizing findings into actionable insights. I learned how to create a comfortable
                environment where interview subjects felt safe sharing honest perspectives about their struggles. The
                affinity mapping process taught me how to identify patterns in qualitative data and translate them into
                design opportunities.
            </p>

            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Beyond the technical skills, I developed a deeper appreciation for the empathy required in human-centered
                design. The research phase isn't about confirming your own assumptions—it's about genuinely listening to
                users and letting their experiences guide the design process. This mindset shift has influenced how I
                approach problem-solving in all my subsequent projects.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-12">Impact and Next Steps</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Our research provided a solid foundation for the remainder of the design sprint. The clear problem
                statement and user persona gave the team confidence that we were addressing real needs rather than
                hypothetical problems. The insights about phone usage timing proved particularly valuable, as they
                suggested specific intervention points where a solution could have maximum impact.
            </p>

            <p class="text-slate-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Moving into the Ideate and Prototype phases, we had a clear target: create a solution that helps students
                establish healthier phone habits during critical times of the day. The research phase had done its job—
                transforming uncertainty into clarity and giving us the direction we needed to design something truly useful.
